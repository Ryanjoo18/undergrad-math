\section{Connectedness}
\begin{definition}[Graph]
A \vocab{graph} $G=(V(G),E(G))$ consists of two sets $V(G)$ (the \vocab{vertex} set) and $E(G)$ (the \vocab{edge} set), where each element of $E(G)$ consists of a pair of elements of $V(G)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}
$|G|=|V(G)|$ denotes the number of vertices and $e(G) =|E(G)|$ denotes the number of edges.
\end{notation}

The \vocab{order} of a graph $G$ is $|V(G)|$. The \vocab{size} of $G$ is $|E(G)|$.

We represent $G$ visually by drawing a point for each vertex and a line between any pair of points that form an edge.

The \vocab{complement} of $G$, denoted by $\overline{G}$, is a graph with the same vertex set as $G$ and $E(\overline{G}) = \{e \notin E(G)\}$, i.e. $\overline{G}$ has edges exactly where there are no edges in $G$.

\begin{notation}
We write $uv=\{u,v\}=vu$ for the (unordered) pair representing an edge between $u$ and $v$.
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}
A loop is an edge $(v,v)$ for some $v \in V$. An edge $e=(u,v)$ is a multiple edge if it appears multiple times in $E$. 

A graph is \vocab{simple} if it has no loops or multiple edges.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, we will only consider simple graphs. General (potentially non-simple) graphs are also called multigraphs.
\end{remark}

Vertices $u$ and $v$ are \vocab{neighbours} if $(u,v) \in E(G)$; we also say that $u$ and $v$ are \vocab{adjacent}. An edge $e \in E(G)$ is \vocab{incident} to a vertex $v \in V(G)$ if $v \in e$. Edges $e, e^\prime$ are \vocab{incident} if $e \cap e^\prime = \emptyset$.

Given a vertex $v$, the \vocab{degree} of $v$, denoted by $d(v)$, is the number of neighbours of $v$ in $G$. If the degree of each vertex is the same, we can call that the degree of the graph. A \vocab{leaf} is a vertex of degree one, i.e. with a unique neighbour.

\begin{remark}
A trivial graph is a graph with order 1. An empty graph is a graph of size 0. 
Note that a graph must have at least one vertex by definition. But a graph can certainly have no edges!
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Subgraph]
$H$ is a \vocab{subgraph} of $G$ if $V(H) \subseteq V(G)$ and $E(H) \subseteq E(G)$.
\end{definition}

$H$ is a \vocab{spanning subgraph} if $V(H)=V(G)$.

$H$ is an \vocab{induced subgraph} if $(u,v) \in E(H) \iff (u,v) \in E(G) \forall u, v \in V(H)$.

\begin{definition}[Walk]
A \vocab{$u-v$ walk} in $G$, denoted by $W$, is a finite sequence of vertices $u=v_0,v_1,\dots,v_k=v$ such that $v_i v_{i+1} \in E(G)$ for all $0 \le i < k-1$.
\end{definition}

If the vertices in $W$ we call it a \vocab{path}.

If $u=v$ we call $W$ a \vocab{closed walk}. Otherwise, it is \vocab{open}.

A \vocab{trail} is an open walk without repeating vertices.

A \vocab{path} is an open walk without repeating edges. Note that paths are trails, but not vice-versa.

A \vocab{circuit} is a closed walk without repeating edges, i.e. $u=v$, it begins and ends with the same vertex.

A \vocab{cycle} is a closed walk without repeating vertices, other than the initial and terminal vertices, i.e. $u=v$ but the vertices are otherwise distinct and $W$ has at least 3 vertices. If a graph $G$ has no cycle we call it \vocab{acyclic}.

A \vocab{trail} is a walk in which no two vertices appear consecutively (in either order) more than once; that is, no edge is used more than once. A \vocab{tour} is a closed trail.

\begin{definition}
A graph $G$ is \vocab{connected} if $\forall u,v \in V(G)$ there exists a $u-v$ path.
\end{definition}

Let $G$ be a connected graph. Then $d(u,v)$ is the \vocab{smallest length} of any $u-v$ path if $u \neq v$, or 0 if $u=v$.

The \vocab{diameter} of a connected graph $G$, denoted by $\diam G$, is defined as
\[ \diam G = \max_{u\neq v} d(u,v). \]
By construction, $d(u,v) \le \diam G \forall u,v \in V(G)$.

We say that two vertices $u$ and $v$ of a graph $G$ lie in the same \vocab{component} if they are joined by an $u-v$ walk. Clearly this forms an equivalence relation and the partition of $V(G)$ into equivalence classes expresses $G$ as a union of disjoint connected graphs called its components.

$G$ is \vocab{complete} if every pair of vertices in $G$ is joined by an edge. A complete graph on $n$ vertices is denoted by $K_n$.

\subsection{Trees}
\begin{definition}
A \vocab{tree} is defined to be a connected graph that does not contain any cycles; to put it simply, it is a minimally connected graph.
\end{definition}

A \vocab{cycle} in a graph means there is a path from an object back to itself.

Characterisation of trees: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices. The following statements are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G$ does not contain any cycles
\item $G$ contains exactly $n-1$ edges
\item For any two vertices, there exists exactly one path joining the two vertices
\item The removal of any edge disconnects the graph
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lemma}\label{acyclic}
Any tree is acyclic.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be a tree, i.e. $G$ is minimally connected. Suppose for a contradiction that $G$ contains a cycle $C$. Let $e \in E(C)$. We will obtain our contradiction by showing that $G-e \coloneqq (V(G),E(G)\setminus\{e\})$ is connected. 

Let $P$ be the path obtained by deleting $e$ from $C$. Consider any $u,v$ in $V(G)$. As $G$ is connected, there is an $u-v$ walk $W$ in $G$. Replacing any use of $e$ in $W$ by $P$ gives an $u-v$ walk in $G-e$. Thus $G-e$ is connected, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

There are many equivalent characterisations of trees, any of which could be taken as the definition. Here is one:

\begin{lemma}\label{tree_iff}
$G$ is a tree if and only if $G$ is connected and acyclic.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
If $G$ is a tree then $G$ is connected by definition and acyclic by \cref{acyclic}. Conversely, let $G$ be connected and acyclic. Suppose for a contradiction that $G-e$ is connected for some $e = (u,v) \in E(G)$.

Let $W$ be a shortest $u-v$ walk in $G-e$. Then $W$ must be a path, i.e. have no repeated vertices, otherwise we would find a shorter walk by deleting a segment of $W$ between two visits to the same vertex. Combining $W$ with $(u,v)$ gives a cycle, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The fact that a shortest walk between two points is a path is often useful. More generally, considering an extremal (shortest, longest, minimal, maximal, \dots) object is often a useful proof technique.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
Any two vertices in a tree are joined by a unique path.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose for a contradiction that this fails for some tree $G$. 

Choose $u,v$ in $V(G)$ so that there are distinct $u-v$ paths P1, P2, and P1 is as short as possible over all such choices of $u$ and $v$.

Then P1 and P2 only intersect in $u$ and $v$, so their union is a cycle, contradicting \cref{acyclic}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{tree_leaves}
Any tree with at least two vertices has at least two leaves.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Consider any tree $G$. Let $P$ be a longest path in $G$. The two ends of $P$ must be leaves. Indeed, an end cannot have a neighbour in $V(G) \setminus V(P)$, or we could make $P$ longer, and cannot have any neighbour in $V(P)$ other than the next in the sequence of $P$, or we would have a cycle.

The existence of leaves in trees is useful for inductive arguments, via the following lemma. Given $v \in V(G)$, let $G-v$ be the graph with $V(G-v) = V(G)\setminus\{v\}$ and $E(G-v) = \{(u,v) \in E(G) \mid v \notin \{u,v\}\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{tree_leaf}
If $G$ is a tree and $v$ is a leaf of $G$ then $G-v$ is a tree.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By \cref{tree_iff} it suffices to show that $G-v$ is connected and acyclic. Acyclicity is immediate from \cref{acyclic}. Connectedness follows by noting for any $u,v \in V(G)\setminus\{v\}$ that the unique $u-v$ path in $G$ is contained in $G-v$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{tree_edges}
Any tree on $n$ vertices has $n-1$ edges.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By induction. A tree with 1 vertex has 0 edges. Let $G$ be a tree on $n>1$ vertices. By \cref{tree_leaves}, $G$ has a leaf $v$. By \cref{tree_leaf}, $G-v$ is a tree. By induction hypothesis, $G-v$ has $n-2$ edges. Replacing $v$ gives $n-1$ edges in $G$.
\end{proof}

We conclude this section with another characterisation of trees. First we note that any connected graph $G$ contains a minimally connected subgraph (i.e. a tree) with the same vertex set, which we call a \vocab{spanning tree} of $G$.

\begin{lemma}
A graph $G$ is a tree on $n$ vertices if and only if $G$ is connected and has $n-1$ edges.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $G$ is a tree then $G$ is connected by definition and has $n-1$ edges by \cref{tree_edges}. 

Conversely, suppose that $G$ is connected and has $n-1$ edges. Let $H$ be a spanning tree of $G$. Then $H$ has $n-1$ edges by \cref{tree_edges}, so $H = G$, so $G$ is a tree.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Classes of graphs}
\vocab{Empty graph}: We let $E_n$ denote the empty graph with order $n$ and size 0. This graph is disconnected if and only if $n \ge 2$.

\vocab{Path graph}: We let $P_n$ be the graph of order $n$ and size $n-1$. You can guess what this is: It is connected with diameter $n-1$.

\vocab{Cycle graph}: We let $C_n$ denote the graph of order $n$ and size $n$ which consists of a single
cycle. Note that $n \ge 3$. It is connected with diameter $\floor{\frac{1}{2}n}$.

\vocab{Complete graph}: We let $K_n$ denote the complete graph, with order $r$ and size $\binom{n}{2}$. It is extremely connected with diameter 1 (for $n \ge 2$). Note that this is the only class of connected graphs with diameter 1.

Note that $E_1 = K_1 = P_1$, $K_2 = P_2$ and $K_3 = C_3$.

\subsection{Bipartite Graphs}
$G$ is \vocab{bipartite} if $V(G)$ can be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ such that no edge has both endpoints in the same set. A graph is said to be \vocab{complete bipartite} if $G$ is bipartite and all possible edges between the two sets $A$ and $B$ are drawn. In the case where $|A|=m, |B|=n$, such a graph is denoted by $K_{m,n}$.

Let $k \ge 2$. A graph $G$ is said to be \vocab{$k$-partite} if $V(G)$ can be partitioned into $k$ pairwise disjoint sets $A_1, \dots, A_k$ such that no edge has both endpoints in the same set. A \vocab{complete $k$-partite} graph is defined similarly as a complete bipartite. In the case where $|A_i| = n_i$, such a graph is denoted by $K_{n_1,n_2,\dots,n_k}$.

A graph is \vocab{planar} if it can be drawn such that a pair of edges can only cross at a vertex.

\begin{theorem}[Euler's Characteristic Formula]
For any connected planar graph, the number of vertices $V$ minus the number of edges $E$ plus the number of regions $R$ equals 2. 
\begin{equation}
V-E+R=2
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

(or V-E+F=2 for 3 dimensional polyhedra)
To prove this, 
for trivial graph, V=1, F=1, E=0
Adding one edge, we either introduce a new vertex or face (if edge is connected to preexisting vertex)

\subsection{Isomorphism}
\begin{definition}[Isomorphism]
Let $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ be graphs. An isomorphism $\phi : G_1 \to G_2$ is a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) from $V_1$ to $V_2$ such that $(u,v) \in E_1$ if and only if $(\phi(u),\phi(v)) \in E_2$. We say $G_1$ is isomorphic to $G_2$ if there is an isomorphism between them.
\end{definition}

\section{Minimum Cost Spanning Trees}
$G$ is a connected graph and we have some cost $c(e)>0$ for every edge $e\in E(G)$. For any $S\subseteq E(G)$ we call $c(S)=\sum_{e\in S}c(e)$ the cost of $S$. The problem we wish to solve is:

\begin{quote}
Find $S\subseteq E(G)$ with minimum possible $c(S)$ such that $(V(G),S)$ is a connected graph.
\end{quote}

A solution is necessarily a spanning tree for $G$. Recall that this is a tree $T=(V(G),S)$ where $S\subseteq E(G)$. We say that $T$ is a minimum cost spanning tree of $G$ if any other spanning tree $T^\prime$ satisfies $c(T^\prime)\ge c(T)$. How can we find one efficiently?

One natural method to try is the ``greedy algorithm'': choose edges one at a time, each time choosing the cheapest edge that does not create a cycle. There are various versions of this algorithm; we will describe the one due to Kruskal.

\begin{theorem}[Kruskal's Algorithm]
At step $i\ge0$, keep track of a subset $A_i\subseteq E(G)$. This will have the property that $(V(G),A_i)$ is acyclic. Start with $A_0=\emptyset$. At step $i\ge0$, is there an edge $e\in E(G)\setminus A_i$ such that $(V(G),A_i\cup\{e\})$ is acyclic? If no, then output $A=A_i$ and stop. If yes, then set $A_{i+1}=A_i\cup\{e\}$ for one such $e$ such that $c(e)$ is minimal, and proceed to step $i+1$.
\end{theorem}

You should try a few examples on small graphs to understand the algorithm and check that it does find minimum cost spanning trees in your examples. However, it is not obvious that it will always work, and indeed there are different problems in graph theory for which greedy algorithms don't always work. Fortunately, the greedy algorithm always works for the minimum cost spanning tree problem, as shown by the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
$(V(G),A)$ is a minimum cost spanning tree of $G$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\section{Euler Tours and Trails}
An \vocab{Euler trail} is a trail in which every pair of adjacent vertices appear consecutively. (That is, every edge is used exactly once.)

An \vocab{Euler tour} is a closed Euler trail.

\section*{Problems}
\begin{prbm}[K\"{o}nigsberg Bridge Problem]
K\"{o}nigsberg was a small town in Prussia. There is a river running through the town and there were seven bridges across the river. The inhabitants of K\"{o}nigsberg liked to walk around the town and cross all of the bridges:

Is it possible to walk around the town and cross every bridge, once and once only?
\end{prbm}

\begin{solution}
We replace every landmass by a vertex and every bridge by an edge to give the following graph.


\end{solution}
\pagebreak

Problems can include tournament, matching, and scheduling problems.
\begin{prbm}(Moser's circle problem) 
Determine the number of regions into which a circle is divided if $n$ points on its circumference are joined by chords with no three internally concurrent.
\end{prbm}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
Consider the graph which has points on the circumference and intersection points between chords as its vertices.

Let $V, E, F$ denote the number of vertices, edges, regions respectively.

To count the number of intersection points, note that $4$ points on the circumference give one unique intersection point between the two non-parallel chords formed by connecting two pairs of points which intersect inside the circle. Hence, number of intersection points is $\dbinom{n}{4}$. 
\[ V = n + \binom{n}{4} \]
Total number of edges includes $n$ circular arcs, number of original chords formed from connecting pairs of points on the circumference
E = no. of original lines + 2 x no. of intersection points
E = n choose 2 + 2 x n choose 4 + n
since there are n circular arcs

Using Euler's Characteristic Formula, we have 
\begin{align*}
F &= E - V - 1 \\
\Aboxed{F &= 1 + \binom{n}{2} + \binom{n}{4}}
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\section{Strict Dominance}
\subsection{Prisoner's Dilemma}
To start off, we will take a look at the \vocab{Prisoner's Dilemma}, which goes as follows:

\begin{quote}
Two thieves plan to rob a store, but the police arrest them for trespassing. The police suspect that they planned to break in but lack the evidence to support such an accusation. They require a confession to charge the suspects. The police offer them the following deal:
\begin{itemize}
\item If no one confesses, both are charged a one month jail sentence each for trespassing.
\item If a rat confesses and the other does not, the rat is not charged but the other is charged a twelve month jail sentence for robbery.
\item If both confess, both are charged an eight month jail sentence each.
\end{itemize}
If both criminals are self-interested and only care about minimising their jail time, should they take the interrogator's deal?
\end{quote}

We condense the above information into a \vocab{payoff matrix} as shown below, where we have two players, A and B. The horizontal rows represent A's choices, while the vertical columns represent B's choices, and each cell contains a combination of their payoffs.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rcc}
\multicolumn{1}{l}{}         & quiet                       & confess                     \\ \cline{2-3} 
\multicolumn{1}{r|}{quiet}   & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{$-1$, $-1$} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{$-12$, $0$} \\ \cline{2-3} 
\multicolumn{1}{r|}{confess} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{$0$, $-12$} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{$-8$, $-8$} \\ \cline{2-3} 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Split or Steal}
The game goes as follows:
\begin{quote}
Each of two players, Sarah and Steve, has to pick one of two balls: inside one ball appears the word ``\textbf{split}'' and inside the other the word ``\textbf{steal}'' (each player is first asked to secretly check which of the two balls in front of him/her is the split ball and which is the steal ball). They make their decisions simultaneously. 
\end{quote}

The possible outcomes are shown in the figure below, where each row is labelled with a possible choice for Sarah and each column with a possible choice for Steven. Each cell in the table thus corresponds to a possible pair of choices and the resulting outcome is written inside the cell.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=12cm]{images/Split_or_steal.png}
\end{figure}

\section{Nash Equilibrium}
\vocab{Nash Equilibrium} is a set of optimal strategies that work against \textit{all} counter-steategies. This means that if any given player were told the strategies of all their opponents, they still would choose to retain their original strategy.
